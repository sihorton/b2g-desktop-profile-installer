b2g-desktop-profile-installer
=============================

b2g-desktop builds for windows do not include a gaia profile (i.e. all of the apps including the homescreen).
The build scripts for the gaia profile only work on linux/mac at the moment. Therefore this installer provides a simple click
to install a pre-built gaia profile.

This project contains the http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ script that is used to compile the installer.
